# Y.O.L.L.A.(Youtube Online Language Learning Assistant)

#Project Description
Yolla's goal is to allow users to look up words they may be having issues with understanding to a 3rd party dictionary API while also having an embedded youtube video of the user's choice. The user can save a word they lookup into their profile for later use if they wish to come back to it later. The user can also save a bookmark of the video they are watching to refer back to the video and time of the bookmark in question. Most importantly we have a transcript of the video's captions and when a user looks up a word they would be able to find mentions of the word in the video and jump to the time of video the word was mentioned.

Technology used: Java, React, Spring, MongoDB, Github, Bootstrap, Gradle, JUnit, Mockito, IFrame API, and the free Dictionary API.
